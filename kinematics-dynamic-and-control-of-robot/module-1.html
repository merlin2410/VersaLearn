<p><span class="selected"><img src="../assets/images/Karel-capek_1754235905976.jpg" alt="" width="103" height="147"></span></p>
<p><em><span class="selected">Karel Čapek</span></em></p>
<p><span class="selected">The word 'robot' was first introduced to the public by the Czech playwright Karel Čapek in his 1920 play&nbsp;</span><em><span class="selected">R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)</span></em><span class="selected">. The term was derived from the Czech word </span><em><span class="selected">robota</span></em><span class="selected">, meaning "forced labor" or "servitude." In the play, the robots were artificial beings built to serve humans, a theme that has resonated through science fiction ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="selected">While science fiction often portrays robots as anthropomorphic machines endowed with intelligence and personality, the engineering definition is more functional. The Robot Institute of America (RIA) provides a widely accepted definition:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span class="selected">"A robot is a reprogrammable, multifunctional manipulator designed to move material, parts, tools, or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks."</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="selected"><img src="../assets/images/Gemini_Generat_1754235947434.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="180"></span></p>
<p><span class="selected">The key elements in this definition are&nbsp;</span><strong><span class="selected">reprogrammability</span></strong><span class="selected"> and </span><strong><span class="selected">versatility</span></strong><span class="selected">. Unlike fixed automation (or "hard automation"), which consists of custom-built machinery designed for a single, high-volume task, a robot can be repurposed for different tasks by changing its programming and end-effector (the tool at the end of its arm). This flexibility makes robotics a cornerstone of modern, agile manufacturing.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="selected">The Definition of Robotics</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="selected">The term </span><strong><span class="selected">robotics</span></strong><span class="selected"> was coined by the science fiction author Isaac Asimov in 1942. He famously formulated the </span><strong><span class="selected">"Three Laws of Robotics"</span></strong><span class="selected"> as a set of ethical principles for robots to follow:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span class="selected">A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="selected">A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="selected">A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="selected">While these laws remain in the realm of fiction, they underscore the concept of a machine designed to operate safely and predictably.</span></p>
<p><span class="selected">In an engineering context, robotics is the interdisciplinary science and technology of the design, construction, operation, and application of robots. It integrates knowledge from several fields:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><span class="selected">Mechanical Engineering:</span></strong><span class="selected"> Kinematics, dynamics, material science, and mechanism design.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><span class="selected">Electrical Engineering:</span></strong><span class="selected"> Electronics, control systems theory, actuators, and sensor design.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><span class="selected">Computer Science:</span></strong><span class="selected"> Programming, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and algorithm design.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="selected">At its core, robotics is the study of the </span><strong><span class="selected">intelligent connection between perception and action</span></strong><span class="selected">. A robot senses its environment, plans a course of action based on that sensory input and its programmed goals, and then acts upon the environment.</span></p></div><div class="quiz-container" data-topic-id="2" data-asset-path="../assets/images/">

<p><em><span class="selected">Remote Manipulator</span></em></p>
<p><strong><span class="selected">1940s-1950s: The Precursors.</span></strong><span class="selected"> After World War II, remotely controlled mechanical manipulators were developed at Argonne and Oak Ridge National Laboratories to handle radioactive materials. These master-slave systems allowed a human operator to guide a remote arm through a series of motions. Concurrently, the development of CNC technology enabled the programming of precise motion paths for machine tools.</span></p>
<div class="image-container"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Unimate_pouring_coffee_for_a_woman_at_Biltmore_Hotel%2C_1967.jpg/500px-Unimate_pouring_coffee_for_a_woman_at_Biltmore_Hotel%2C_1967.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="198"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/08/16/business/DEVOL2-obit/DEVOL2-obit-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" alt="" width="300" height="200"></div>
<p><em><span class="selected">Unimate </span></em></p>
<p><strong><span class="selected">1954-1961: The First Industrial Robot.</span></strong><span class="selected"> Inventor George Devol patented a "Programmed Article Transfer" device in 1954, combining the articulated arm of a teleoperator with the programmability of a CNC machine. In 1956, Devol and entrepreneur Joseph Engelberger founded </span><strong><span class="selected">Unimation</span></strong><span class="selected">, the world's first robotics company. In 1961, the first "Unimate" robot was installed at a General Motors plant to tend a die-casting machine. This marked the beginning of industrial robotics. The key innovation was its reprogrammability, allowing it to be adapted to new tasks at a relatively low cost.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="selected">1960s-1970s: Adding Senses and Intelligence.</span></strong><span class="selected"> The utility of robots was greatly enhanced through sensory feedback. In 1962, Heinrich Ernst developed a robot with force sensing that could stack blocks. This led to the creation of the Project MAC (Man And Computer) at MIT. Around the same time, early robot vision systems were developed. Several foundational robot arms, such as the </span><strong><span class="selected">Stanford Arm</span></strong><span class="selected">, were created at universities, driving research forward. In 1968, Unimation granted a license to Kawasaki Heavy Industries, beginning the rapid adoption and development of robotics in Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="selected"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Unimate_500_PUMA_Deutsches_Museum.jpg/500px-Unimate_500_PUMA_Deutsches_Museum.jpg" alt="" width="190" height="220"></span></p>
<p><em><span class="selected">PUMA</span></em></p>
<p><strong><span class="selected">1970s: The Rise of Software and Assembly.</span></strong><span class="selected"> The first high-level robot programming language, </span><strong><span class="selected">WAVE</span></strong><span class="selected">, was developed at Stanford in 1973. In 1974, Cincinnati Milacron introduced the first computer-controlled industrial robot, the </span><strong><span class="selected">T&sup3; (The Tomorrow Tool)</span></strong><span class="selected">. A major breakthrough in assembly came from the Draper Laboratories with the invention of the Remote Center Compliance (RCC) device, a passive mechanical wrist that greatly simplified part-insertion tasks. This era culminated in Unimation's introduction of the </span><strong><span class="selected">PUMA (Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly)</span></strong><span class="selected"> in 1978, which became a standard in both industry and research for many years.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="selected">1980s: A Focus on Dynamics and Control.</span></strong><span class="selected"> The 1980s saw a shift from building new robot mechanisms to understanding the fundamental mathematics governing their motion. Researchers developed efficient recursive algorithms (Lagrangian and Newton-Euler formulations) for computing robot dynamics. This enabled the development of advanced control strategies like </span><strong><span class="selected">"computed torque" control</span></strong><span class="selected">, which used a mathematical model of the robot's dynamics to achieve highly accurate trajectory tracking. In 1981, a </span><strong><span class="selected">direct-drive robot</span></strong><span class="selected">, which eliminated the need for gear reduction, was developed at Carnegie Mellon University by Haruhiko Asada, leading to higher speed and accuracy.</span></p>

</div><div class='topic-section' id='topic-5'><h1>Degrees of Freedom (DOF))</h1><div class='topic-content'><p><span class="selected">Before we can analyze the motion of a robot, we must first quantify its capacity for motion. This is done using the concept of </span><strong><span class="selected">Degrees of Freedom (DOF)</span></strong><span class="selected">.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="selected">The </span><strong><span class="selected">Degrees of Freedom (DOF)</span></strong><span class="selected"> of a body is the number of independent parameters required to completely specify its configuration (position and orientation) in space.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="selected">The DOF of a robot's end-effector determines its ability to reach different points and achieve different orientations. The number of joints in a manipulator is often referred to as its degrees of freedom, as each joint typically provides one independent parameter of motion.</span></p>
<p><span class="selected">Let's build this concept from a simple point to a full rigid body.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><span class="selected">DOF of a Point:</span></strong><span class="selected"> A point is a geometric entity with no size or orientation. We only need to specify its position.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="selected">In </span><strong><span class="selected">1D space</span></strong><span class="selected"> (a line), a point can only move along that line. Its position can be described by a single variable (e.g.,\((x,y)\))</span><span class="selected">. Therefore, it has </span><strong><span class="selected">1 DOF</span></strong><span class="selected">.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="selected">In </span><strong><span class="selected">2D space</span></strong><span class="selected"> (a plane), a point's position is described by two coordinates (e.g., \((x,y)\))</span><span class="selected">. Therefore, it has </span><strong><span class="selected">2 DOF</span></strong><span class="selected">.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="selected">In </span><strong><span class="selected">3D space</span></strong><span class="selected">, a point's position is described by three coordinates (e.g., \((x,y)\)</span><span class="selected">). Therefore, it has </span><strong><span class="selected">3 DOF</span></strong><span class="selected">.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><span class="selected">DOF of a Rigid Body:</span></strong><span class="selected"> A rigid body is an object of a fixed size and shape. Unlike a point, we must specify not only its position but also its </span><strong><span class="selected">orientation</span></strong><span class="selected">.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><span class="selected">In 2D Space (Planar):</span></strong><span class="selected"> Consider a flat object moving on a tabletop. To specify its configuration, we need to know the position of a reference point on the object (2 parameters: $</span><span class="base"><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mord mathnormal">y</span><span class="mclose">)$</span></span><span class="selected">) and its angle of rotation about an axis perpendicular to the plane (1 parameter: $\theta</span><span class="mord mathnormal">$</span><span class="selected">).</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="selected">Total DOF = 2 (for position) + 1 (for orientation) = </span><strong><span class="selected">3 DOF</span></strong><span class="selected">.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><span class="selected">In 3D Space:</span></strong><span class="selected"> This is the most general case for robotics. To specify the configuration of a rigid body in 3D space, we need:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><span class="selected">3 parameters for position:</span></strong><span class="selected"> The $</span><span class="base"><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mord mathnormal">y</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mord mathnormal">z</span><span class="mclose">)$</span></span><span class="selected"> coordinates of a reference point on the body.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><span class="selected">3 parameters for orientation:</span></strong><span class="selected"> Describing the body's rotation in space. This is more complex than the 2D case. While there are many ways to represent 3D orientation (e.g., Euler angles, quaternions), it can be proven that three independent parameters are required. Common conventions include describing rotations about three principal axes (e.g., roll, pitch, and yaw).</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="selected">Total DOF = 3 (for position) + 3 (for orientation) = </span><strong><span class="selected">6 DOF</span></strong><span class="selected">.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="selected">This value is fundamental: </span><strong><span class="selected">an unconstrained rigid body in 3D space has 6 degrees of freedom.</span></strong><span class="selected"> This means that for a general-purpose robotic manipulator to be able to place its end-effector in any arbitrary position and orientation within its workspace, it must have at least 6 degrees of freedom.</span></p></div></div><div class='topic-section' id='topic-6'><h1>Interactive Lab: Degrees of Freedom</h1><div class='topic-content'><p>This is an interactive tool for you to get a grasp on the concept of degrees of freedom.</p></div><div class="simulator-wrapper">
