<p><em><span class="selected">Karel Čapek</span></em></p>
<p><span class="selected">The word 'robot' was first introduced to the public by the Czech playwright Karel Čapek in his 1920 play&nbsp;</span><em><span class="selected">R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)</span></em><span class="selected">. The term was derived from the Czech word </span><em><span class="selected">robota</span></em><span class="selected">, meaning "forced labor" or "servitude." In the play, the robots were artificial beings built to serve humans, a theme that has resonated through science fiction ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="selected">While science fiction often portrays robots as anthropomorphic machines endowed with intelligence and personality, the engineering definition is more functional. The Robot Institute of America (RIA) provides a widely accepted definition:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span class="selected">"A robot is a reprogrammable, multifunctional manipulator designed to move material, parts, tools, or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks."</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="selected"><img src="../../assets/images/Gemini_Generat_1754235947434.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="180"></span></p>
<p><span class="selected">The key elements in this definition are&nbsp;</span><strong><span class="selected">reprogrammability</span></strong><span class="selected"> and </span><strong><span class="selected">versatility</span></strong><span class="selected">. Unlike fixed automation (or "hard automation"), which consists of custom-built machinery designed for a single, high-volume task, a robot can be repurposed for different tasks by changing its programming and end-effector (the tool at the end of its arm). This flexibility makes robotics a cornerstone of modern, agile manufacturing.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="selected">The Definition of Robotics</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="selected">The term </span><strong><span class="selected">robotics</span></strong><span class="selected"> was coined by the science fiction author Isaac Asimov in 1942. He famously formulated the </span><strong><span class="selected">"Three Laws of Robotics"</span></strong><span class="selected"> as a set of ethical principles for robots to follow:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span class="selected">A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="selected">A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="selected">A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="selected">While these laws remain in the realm of fiction, they underscore the concept of a machine designed to operate safely and predictably.</span></p>
<p><span class="selected">In an engineering context, robotics is the interdisciplinary science and technology of the design, construction, operation, and application of robots. It integrates knowledge from several fields:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><span class="selected">Mechanical Engineering:</span></strong><span class="selected"> Kinematics, dynamics, material science, and mechanism design.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><span class="selected">Electrical Engineering:</span></strong><span class="selected"> Electronics, control systems theory, actuators, and sensor design.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><span class="selected">Computer Science:</span></strong><span class="selected"> Programming, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and algorithm design.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="selected">At its core, robotics is the study of the </span><strong><span class="selected">intelligent connection between perception and action</span></strong><span class="selected">. A robot senses its environment, plans a course of action based on that sensory input and its programmed goals, and then acts upon the environment.</span></p></div><div class="quiz-container" data-topic-id="2" data-asset-path="../../assets/images/">
