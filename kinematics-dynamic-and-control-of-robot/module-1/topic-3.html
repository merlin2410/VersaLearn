<p><em><span class="selected">Remote Manipulator</span></em></p>
<p><strong><span class="selected">1940s-1950s: The Precursors.</span></strong><span class="selected"> After World War II, remotely controlled mechanical manipulators were developed at Argonne and Oak Ridge National Laboratories to handle radioactive materials. These master-slave systems allowed a human operator to guide a remote arm through a series of motions. Concurrently, the development of CNC technology enabled the programming of precise motion paths for machine tools.</span></p>

<p><em><span class="selected">Unimate </span></em></p>
<p><strong><span class="selected">1954-1961: The First Industrial Robot.</span></strong><span class="selected"> Inventor George Devol patented a "Programmed Article Transfer" device in 1954, combining the articulated arm of a teleoperator with the programmability of a CNC machine. In 1956, Devol and entrepreneur Joseph Engelberger founded </span><strong><span class="selected">Unimation</span></strong><span class="selected">, the world's first robotics company. In 1961, the first "Unimate" robot was installed at a General Motors plant to tend a die-casting machine. This marked the beginning of industrial robotics. The key innovation was its reprogrammability, allowing it to be adapted to new tasks at a relatively low cost.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="selected">1960s-1970s: Adding Senses and Intelligence.</span></strong><span class="selected"> The utility of robots was greatly enhanced through sensory feedback. In 1962, Heinrich Ernst developed a robot with force sensing that could stack blocks. This led to the creation of the Project MAC (Man And Computer) at MIT. Around the same time, early robot vision systems were developed. Several foundational robot arms, such as the </span><strong><span class="selected">Stanford Arm</span></strong><span class="selected">, were created at universities, driving research forward. In 1968, Unimation granted a license to Kawasaki Heavy Industries, beginning the rapid adoption and development of robotics in Japan.</span></p>

<p><em><span class="selected">PUMA</span></em></p>
<p><strong><span class="selected">1970s: The Rise of Software and Assembly.</span></strong><span class="selected"> The first high-level robot programming language, </span><strong><span class="selected">WAVE</span></strong><span class="selected">, was developed at Stanford in 1973. In 1974, Cincinnati Milacron introduced the first computer-controlled industrial robot, the </span><strong><span class="selected">T&sup3; (The Tomorrow Tool)</span></strong><span class="selected">. A major breakthrough in assembly came from the Draper Laboratories with the invention of the Remote Center Compliance (RCC) device, a passive mechanical wrist that greatly simplified part-insertion tasks. This era culminated in Unimation's introduction of the </span><strong><span class="selected">PUMA (Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly)</span></strong><span class="selected"> in 1978, which became a standard in both industry and research for many years.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="selected">1980s: A Focus on Dynamics and Control.</span></strong><span class="selected"> The 1980s saw a shift from building new robot mechanisms to understanding the fundamental mathematics governing their motion. Researchers developed efficient recursive algorithms (Lagrangian and Newton-Euler formulations) for computing robot dynamics. This enabled the development of advanced control strategies like </span><strong><span class="selected">"computed torque" control</span></strong><span class="selected">, which used a mathematical model of the robot's dynamics to achieve highly accurate trajectory tracking. In 1981, a </span><strong><span class="selected">direct-drive robot</span></strong><span class="selected">, which eliminated the need for gear reduction, was developed at Carnegie Mellon University by Haruhiko Asada, leading to higher speed and accuracy.</span></p>
